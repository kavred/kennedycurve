                <h2>About This Website</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Kennedy Curve Calculator, a tool designed specifically for educators who want to apply a curve to their students' scores. This website revolutionizes the process of calculating scaled grades using the Kennedy Curve method, making it effortless for educators to ensure fair and consistent grading across their classes.</p>

                <h2>What is the Kennedy Curve?</h2>
                <p>The Kennedy Curve is an grade adjustment algorithm that normalizes student scores by scaling them based on class performance analytics. This sophisticated approach is particularly powerful when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assessment difficulty varies between evaluations</li>
                    <li>You want to ensure optimal grade distribution</li>
                    <li>Class performance metrics differ from expected benchmarks</li>
                    <li>You need to maintain consistent grading standards across multiple sections</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <h3>Advanced Algorithm</h3>
                    <p>The Kennedy Curve employs a mathematical transformation that intelligently adjusts raw scores to better reflect student performance relative to class analytics. This ensures that grades are distributed with precision and fairness.</p>
